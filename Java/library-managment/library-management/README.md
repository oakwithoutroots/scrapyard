# Library Management (Practice Project)

## Premise
Practicing the methods learned so far, I want to try and build out an application on my own.
The application will be for the building out and maintaining of a library's catalogue.

This is a basic application, but the requirements I'm setting for myself are as follows:  

**Base Feature Requirements:**
* [ ] Add a book
* [ ] Checkout a book
* [ ] Remove a book (with confirmation)
* [ ] Search for a Book*  (*Continued Below)
* [ ] References Page
  * [ ] View by Criteria
      * [ ] View Books by Genre
      * [ ] View Books by Authors
* [ ] Exit Program (with confirmation)

**Higher Level Requirements:**
* [ ] Detailed Search Parameters
  * [ ] Search by Author (using first few characters or full name)
  * [ ] Search by Genre
  * [ ] Search by Publication Date
  * [ ] Search by Multiple Criteria (Stretch Goal)
* [ ] View Checkout Date / Returned by Date
==== 

These are my starting goals as of 11/30/2022. Additionally, 
I want to be able for this program to Read/Write to a repository, work with MVC, and used CRUD principles.
